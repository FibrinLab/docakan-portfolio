excerpt: "Reflections on designing healthcare systems that serve both clinicians and patients, and the tension between technical elegance and practical necessity."

I've spent the last several years working at the intersection of clinical practice and technology. This has given me a particular perspective on how systems are built, how they fail, and what makes them actually useful.

Most healthcare technology is built with good intentions. The problem is that good intentions don't guarantee good outcomes. Too often, we optimize for the wrong things: feature counts, technical sophistication, or market appeal, rather than the daily experience of the people who will use these systems.

I've learned to ask a simple question: does this make the work easier, or harder? If the answer isn't immediately clear, we're probably building the wrong thing.

The best systems I've encountered share a few characteristics. They're predictable—you know what will happen when you interact with them. They're transparent—you can see what's happening and why. And they're forgiving—they don't punish small mistakes with catastrophic consequences.

This isn't just about user interface design, though that matters. It's about understanding the context in which these systems operate: the time pressure, the cognitive load, the competing priorities that define clinical work. When we ignore that context, we build systems that look good in demos but fail in practice.

I've also learned that the most important work often happens in the gaps: the moments between formal processes, the informal communication channels, the workarounds that emerge when systems don't quite fit. Understanding these gaps is essential. Sometimes we need to close them. Sometimes we need to preserve them. The skill is knowing which is which.

Building systems that matter requires patience. It requires listening more than talking. It requires being willing to throw away elegant solutions when they don't serve the people who need them. And it requires accepting that perfect is the enemy of good, especially in healthcare, where good enough today is often better than perfect tomorrow.

These are lessons I'm still learning. I expect I'll be learning them for a long time.
